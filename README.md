# git-llm-utils

Git llm message tools powered by LLMs automatically generates meaningful commit messages based on your changes.

## What it does

- Allows generating git commit messages from the repository staged changes
- The commnit message can be generated with:
    - the standard git message workflow with a Git hook to capture your staged changes diff (the hook can be installed with a command).
    - with a commit command: `git-llm-utils commit`
- The diff message is generated with the configured llm (groq, ollama or any [Litellm](https://models.litellm.ai/) supported model)
- All configurations are stored using git config storage support
- Helps you maintain clean, consistent, human-readable commit history without manual effort.

## Why use it

- 🕒 **Save time** — no more writing commit messages for every change.
- ✅ **Consistency** — a unified style and format across commits.
- 📚 **Clarity** — automated summaries help communicate *what changed and why*.
- 🤝 **Lower friction for contributors** — beneficial in collaborative or open-source projects, or when onboarding new team members.

## Getting started

### Building from the source:

1. Clone the repo: 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:pilardi/git-llm-utils.git
```
2. Build the environment (you'll need uv package manager installed in your system)
```bash
cd git-llm-utils && make install
```
3. Activate the environment and build the binary in your system
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && make dist/git-llm-utils
```
4. Ensure your environment (or config) provides credentials to access a suitable LLM (see [Configuration](#configuration))
```bash
git-llm-utils verify
```
5. Go to a repository where you want to use the tool and stage some changes
```bash
cd _your_repository_path_here_ && git-llm-utils status
```
6. Commit the changes with the generated message: (all actions need to be confirmed by the user unless you pass the `--no-confirm` option before the action)
```bash
git-llm-utils commit
```

### Using the binary

You can use the binary distribution located in dist/git-llm-utils or in the github release artifacts, you only need to add it your `PATH`

## Usage

See:

```bash
git-llm-utils --help
```

## Configuration:
See:

```bash
git-llm-utils --config
```

by default the application uses `ollama/qwen3-coder:480b-cloud` as the model, therefore you'd need to have [ollama](https://ollama.com/download) running in your machine or configure a host where ollama would be running (using `api_url`)

### Settings
All configuration settings are made using git config settings:

- `emojis`: `True` will allow the llm to generate Emojis in the commit message
- `comments`: `True` will generate the message with commented lines
- `model`: `ollama/qwen3-coder:480b-cloud` use [Litellm](https://models.litellm.ai/) syntaxis
- `api_key`: None
- `api_url`: None (will use Litellm defaults, for ollama it's `http://127.0.0.1:11434`)
- `description_file`: `README.md` will use this file for context to the llm as as tool (if allowed)
- `use_tools`: `False` will allow the LLM to access the description of your repository
- `manual`: `True` if True will not generate the commit message for every git commit when the commit hook is installed, unless the env `GIT_LLM_ON=True` is set

Use:

```bash
git-llm-utils set-config setting --value value
```
to change the setting, where *setting* is any of the available [settings](#settings)
